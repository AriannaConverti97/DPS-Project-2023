# Project Setup

* You can import the project directly from a *Version Control System*, by providing the following URL: 
TODO

<img src = './assets/img_1.png'>

* Otherwise, take care to import the project as a Gradle Project

* If required, trust the project and accept the Gradle auto-import

* Wait until the Gradle indexing process ends (it may take a few seconds)



## ENJOY THE PROJECT!
